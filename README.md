# Node CSV

- Situation: My wife and I have a few debit and credit cards.
- Problem: I like to track and categorize all expenses in my own Excel/Google Sheets file
  - manually inputting each entry takes too much time. I just want to categorize.
- Solution: This script takes a bunch of csv files and merges them into one.
